# Face-Recognition
Hello, I'm Kashyap and I'm an intermediate python programmer mainly focusing on leetcode. I love ML (machine learning) and I wanted to extend my knwoledge on it. I thought the best way to do so was to build a simple face recgonition software.

# Resources

For this projet I decided to use OpenCV, Python3, and Pillow.

Hope you enjoy it!
